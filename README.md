# hello-world

Welcome to Munashe's World!!

You are one lazy person that likes to give orders than take them.
You travel a lot but rarely step out of your roof.
You definitely love coffee and low light areas.
You are adventurers yet, you're no scientist.
You are the best.

As a programmer I learnt to "NIKE"
"NIKE" >= JUSTDOIT
..hence why you should too.
//justdoit_chizzy...that's me.
